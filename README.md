Void Clicker is an autoclicker made in a single batch file.

---
Void Clicker uses some trickery to run Powershell code in the same file which then runs C# code making it able to simulate a click.

We do have a Discord where updates and other programs are released and we would love you to join.
You can join [here.](https://discord.gg/yqpeRXC)

**Void Clicker is going to soon be renamed and have a big new update. We strongly recommend that you join the Discord so you can stay up to date and get new features, GUI, and fix detectability issues. You can join the Discord server [here.](https://discord.gg/yqpeRXC)**

## How to use
A lot of people get quite confused on how to use Void Clicker due to it not being like most other autoclickers out there.

There are also some things to keep in mind like:
- The CPS may not be the same to what you set it as due to how the randomization code was written (it was written a long while ago). 
- When you run the autoclicker, the name of the file will be randomized.
- The `MC ONLY` module only works on the Java Edition of Minecraft.
- There will also be a new update coming soon and this wont be something that will be kept up to date anymore.

Here is how to navigate the menu.

    W - Move up through the modules
    S - Move down through the modules
    A - Turn down the value of selected module
    D - Turn up the value of selected module
    X - Self destruct
    V - Start the clicker
    E - Enables or disables the currently selected mouse button
    Q - Changes selected mouse button

Once you have started the clicker you can toggle the clicker using `V` and stop it using `Delete`.

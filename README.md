Void Clicker is an autoclicker made in a single batch file.

---
Void Clicker uses some trickery to run Powershell code in the same file which then runs C# code making it able to simulate a click.

We do have a Discord where updates and other programs are released and we would love you to join.

**Void Clicker is going to soon be renamed and have a big new update. We strongly recommend that you join the Discord so you can stay up to date and get new features, GUI, and fix detectability issues. You can join the Discord server [here.](https://discord.gg/yqpeRXC)**
